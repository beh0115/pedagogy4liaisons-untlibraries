[why this is important]

Anderson and May present their field research on the “effectiveness of delivery methods in information literacy instruction.” The authors explore face-to-face, online, and blended learning instructional formats to discover which method(s) impact “students’ retention of information literacy skills.” Their results aim to support an “inclusive model of information literacy.”
