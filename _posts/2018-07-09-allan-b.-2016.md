# _Emerging Strategies for Supporting Student Learning: A Practical Guide for Librarians and Educators_

Allan, Barbara. 2016. _Emerging Strategies for Supporting Student Learning: A practical Guide for Librarians and Educators_. London: Facet Publishing. https://iii.library.unt.edu/record=b5762493~S12.

Allan presents a variety of different theories, teaching approaches, and learning styles that are shaping the “current higher education landscape.” She examines how these facets can be used within the library to enhance information instruction. Her aim is to present this information in a way that assists librarians with “designing, developing, and evaluating” their courses and teaching methods to impact student learning.
