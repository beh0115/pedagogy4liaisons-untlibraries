# Comprehensive and Intensive Anthologies

In this section, you will find a list of anthologies whose suggested content equaled the majority of the contents. For the brevity of this document, individual chapters are not annotated. Chapter recommendations provided.  


Accardi, Maria T., Emily Drabinski, and Alana Kumbier, eds. 2010. Critical Library Instruction: Theories and Methods. Minnesota: Library Juice Press.  
IBSN: [Link to UNT Record](https://iii.library.unt.edu/record=b3837775~S12).


<p style="text-indent: 40px">The editors introduce the concept of praxis-based pedagogy for instruction librarians. They recognize the gap between theories taught in library school and the practices of those working in the field. They, too, recognize the gap in showing students where to find information on the library website and teaching them information literacy as well as the struggle to fill this gap in a 50 minute time slot to students that the librarian may never see again. They argue that adopting critical theory into library instruction not only increase the relevancy of the instruction itself but it also deeps the learning experience of the students.</p>    
*Suggested Chapters: 1-2, 4-5, 6-9, 11, 14-22.*


Leckie, Gloria J., Lisa M. Given, and John E. Buschman, eds. 2010. Critical Theory for Library and Information Science: Exploring the Social from Across the Disciplines. California: ABC-CLIO, LLC.  
IBSN: [Link to UNT Record](https://iii.library.unt.edu/record=b4373524~S12). 


<p style="text-indent: 40px">This anthology examines continental philosophies and critical theories to provoke critique of the LIS profession. They argue that what critical theory has been featured in the profession so far is highly appropriated and often lacks fundamental “understanding of the theoretical frameworks.” They claim that the need to properly incorporate theory into the profession is strong because it allows professionals to grain better of understanding of the discourses and practices in the disciplines that librarians serve. By integrating theory into the profession, librarians enhance their relevancy to their academic communities. In the text, librarians will rediscover familiar theorists, like Bourdieu, Derrida, Foucault, Freire, Habermas, Heidegger, Marx, and Negri, and will be introduced to others less familiar to the LIS profession, like Aglietta, Barthes, Certeau, Deleuze, Giddens, Giroux, Gramsci, Guattari, Lave, Mouffe, Saussure, and Spivak. </p>   
*Suggested Chapters: 1, 2, 4-9, 11-14, 16-23.*

IBSN: [Link to UNT Record](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/unt/detail.action?docID=4805354#). 


<p style="text-indent: 40px">As a practical handbook for instruction librarians, this book seeks to aid in the development and support of librarians, colleagues, and supervisors by sharing the experiences of the authors.

Pagowsky, Nicole and Kelly McElroy. 2016 Critical Library Pedagogy Handbook Vol. 1, Illinois: American Libraries Association. 
IBSN: [Link to UNT Record](https://iii.library.unt.edu/record=b5717285~S12).

<p style="text-indent: 40px">In first part of this two part volumes, Pagowsky and McElroy admit that critical pedagogy can often be alienating due to the complex jargon and theories it introduces. Their focus on this series is to introduce reflectivity and social justice to in practical ways that reduce hegemonic norms (from academia) in librarian practice. They aim to encourage librarians to engage in praxes through essays highlighting personal practices, projects, and ideology that have been influential to librarians integrating critical pedagogy into their work. With this aim in mind, they provide workbook activities at the end of the first (this) volume. Note: the second volume contains lesson plans which have been distributed throughout the Types of Pedagogy section.</p>   
*Suggested Chapters: 1-2, 4-10, 12-22, 24-25, 28-30.*

Sonnenwald, Dianne. 2016. Theory Development in the Information Sciences. Austin: Univ. of Texas Press. 
IBSN: [Link to UNT Record](https://iii.library.unt.edu/record=b5715426~S12). 

<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sonnenwald attributes the lack of theoretical foundation to the LIS profession to the broad spectrum of the profession itself. The broad nature of the profession and the absent theoretical stability makes adopting theory and pedagogy difficult for LIS practioners. Sonnenwald and the authors in the text aim to share the difficulties, achievements, and enthusiasms of those who have endeavored to use theory and pedagogy.</p>  
*Suggested Chapters: 1-2, 4-11, 15, 17.*
