# pedagogy4liaisons
A digital annotated bibliography that contains resources for the subject librarians and liaisons at the UNT Libraries. 

## _Pedagogy for Librarians: Resources for the Subject Librarians and Liaisons at the UNT Libraries_

### Introduction: About the Project
This repository is a digtal copy of an annotated bibliography produced for the UNT Libraries' Subject Librarian Workgroup. This digital platform allows for collaboration between the UNT liaisons to produce a list of resources for self-directed learning in pedagogy and theory in librarianship that may inform librarianship practices at the UNT Libraries.

>The annotated bibliography aims to provide librarians with resources to help them start: 1) exploring the connections between literacy, pedagogy, philosophy, and theory in librarianship; 2) exploring library pedagogies as well as pedagogies from other disciplines that compliment library work; and 3) exploring strategic ways to engage with faculty and instructional designers. 

Most annotations in this bibliography were created from abstracts or editor-provided summaries of each work. Therefore, they vary in length and depth. The catagories combine pedagogies that are similar in scope or philosophical purpose. This annotated bibliography is not exhaustive.

This annotated bibliography is not exhaustive and more work needs to be done. 
>The complier intends for this bibliography and its assocated documents to be a "living project," in that all UNT Librarians may add to it as the UNT Libraries' Subject Librarian Workgroup progresses through pedagogy and similar topics in training meetings. Librarians outside of UNT are invited to suggest additional resources as well.

If there are materials that you would like added to this list or if you would like to revise an existing annotation, please send them to the Liaison Workgroup Co-Chairs or the project complier, Brea Henson, by email or use the GitHub pull feature.
